2. **Timeline Issue**: First transaction (August 13, 2025) predates fund creation (August 15, 2025)
3. **Balance Accuracy**: Despite missing initial balance, current calculations match the database balance
4. **Transaction Period**: August 13 - September 4, 2025 (23 days)
5. **Net Negative Flow**: More expenses than income (-1,820,582)

## Recommendations
1. Add an initial balance transaction of 32,123,886 dated August 15, 2025
2. Review transaction dates that predate fund creation
3. Consider creating a specific category for initial balance transactions
4. Verify data integrity for other funds in the system
