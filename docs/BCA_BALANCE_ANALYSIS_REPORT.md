## Root Cause Analysis

### Missing Initial Balance Transaction
The analysis reveals that the BCA fund was created with an **implied initial balance of 32,123,886** that was never recorded as a transaction. This explains the discrepancy between:
- The calculated balance from transactions (-1,820,582)
- The actual current balance (30,303,304)

### Timeline Issues
Interestingly, the first transaction (August 13, 2025) occurred **2 days before** the fund was officially created (August 15, 2025), suggesting the fund existed with a balance before being formally registered in the system.

## Recommendations

### 1. Add Missing Initial Balance Transaction
Create an initial balance transaction for **32,123,886** dated August 13, 2025 (or earlier) to properly reflect the fund's starting balance.

### 2. Transaction Categories for Initial Balance
Consider creating a specific category for "Initial Balance" or "Opening Balance" transactions to clearly identify fund starting amounts.

### 3. Data Integrity Check
Review other funds to ensure they don't have similar missing initial balance issues.
